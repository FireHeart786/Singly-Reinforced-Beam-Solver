# Singly-Reinforced-Beam-Solver
A Problem solver which can design the singly reinforced beam using IS456:2000

I have made a Python program to design a singly reinforced beam using IS 456:2000

My program not just gives the main ans as output instead in solves each step,shows calculations on each step and it even shows the reference clauses  used from IS 456:2000

Its not just a problem solver its a complete simulator to solve the numerical and to design a singly reinforced beam using IS 456:2000 in faster way

This is what makes my program different from others

cons:

It can only solve the simply supported beam with udl soon with improvements new versions of updated code will be released and cantilever beam for different loading conditions will also be added soon
